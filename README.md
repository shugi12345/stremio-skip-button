# 🚀 Unofficial Intro Skip Plugin for Stremio Enhanced

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Author:** shugi12345  

> 🌍 Community-powered “Skip Intro” for shows and movies in **Stremio Enhanced**.  
> Everyone contributes timestamps; once someone saves an intro range, it becomes available to everyone.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎬 Detects the current episode and shows a **Skip Intro** button when you're in the intro segment.  
- ✍️ Community-editable intro ranges: anyone can add or correct the start/end times.  
- 🔄 Automatic sharing: saved ranges are stored centrally and propagate to other users.  
- ⏪ Robust handling of seeks/rewinds so the skip button reappears if you go back into the intro.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Install Stremio Enhanced**  
   You must use [Stremio Enhanced](https://github.com/REVENGE977/stremio-enhanced) — it’s the only version that supports plugins with direct access to modify the player behavior. ⭐

2. **Add the SkipIntro plugin**  
   - Open Stremio Enhanced.  
   - Go into **Settings** and scroll all the way to the bottom.  
   - Open the **Plugins** folder.  
   - Download `skip-intro.plugin.js` from the **Releases** tab of this GitHub repository and place it into the plugins folder. 📦

3. **Start watching**  
   Play any episode. If an intro range exists (or after you add one), the skip button will appear during the intro. ▶️

## 🧠 How to Use

This is a **community-based project**: intro timestamps must be created manually by users.

1. ▶️ Play an episode.  
2. 👀 Look for the small **clock icon** (setup button) in the control bar.  
3. 🕒 Click it to open the editor popup.  
4. ✏️ Enter the **Start** and **End** time of the intro (format `MM:SS`).  
5. 💾 Click **Save**.  
   - That range is saved centrally and becomes available to others.  
   - Once the range is present, a **Skip Intro** button appears when playback enters the specified range.  
6. ↩️ If you rewind back into the intro, the skip button will reappear (thanks to improved seek handling).

## 📝 Notes

- ⚠️ The plugin does **not** increment the version number automatically; versioning is manual. Do **not** update the version in the header unless you intend to release a new version.  
- 🗂️ Intro ranges are cached per episode but will refresh when you re-enter an episode or if the range is missing.  
- 🤖 This code was mostly AI-generated; this project could have taken a lot longer, but using AI made it a few-day project. Hoping to build more with it.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Saved range doesn’t appear for others**  
  The project relies on a central server. If saving fails, check console logs for network errors and ensure your connection to the server is intact. 🔍

## 🧪 Development

The core script is self-contained and injected into the Stremio Enhanced context. Key behaviors:  
- 🔎 Fetches current episode ID and associated intro range from the backend.  
- 🖼️ Shows "Skip Intro" UI when playback enters the defined range.  
- ✍️ Allows users to edit or create new ranges via an inline popup.  
- 🔁 Listens to both `timeupdate` and `seeked` to handle scrubbing and rewinds.
